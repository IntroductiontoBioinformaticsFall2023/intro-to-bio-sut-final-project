### Project Description: Comparative Mitochondrial Genomics and Phylogenetic Analysis

#### Overview

This project focuses on the comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes from different species, primarily birds, mammals, and insects. The aim is to understand the evolutionary relationships between these species by analyzing and comparing their mitochondrial DNA, which is about 16,000 base pairs in length. You will use advanced computational methods to construct phylogenetic trees and delve into the ecological and anthropological insights that can be gleaned from this data. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial genomics, its importance in evolutionary biology, and its applications in broader scientific contexts.

You will learn:

- Techniques for aligning and comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences.
- How to construct and interpret phylogenetic trees using advanced computational methods.
- The application of mitochondrial genomics in understanding ecological interactions and human evolutionary history.

#### Task Roadmap

1. **Mitochondrial Genome Comparison**:
   - Align mitochondrial DNA sequences from the provided dataset.
   - Analyze these sequences to identify similarities and differences across species.

2. **Phylogenetic Analysis Using Advanced Methods**:
   - Apply Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference methods, utilizing tools like `ETE Toolkit`, `DendroPy`, `BEAST`, or `PyRate`.
   - Compare the trees generated by these methods to understand how different approaches can lead to different interpretations of the data.

3. **Cross-Disciplinary Applications (Bonus)**:
   - **Ecology**: Examine how mitochondrial DNA analysis can reveal information about species adaptation, migration, and conservation. This involves understanding how genetic variation within and between species can inform ecological strategies and conservation efforts.
   - **Anthropology**: Investigate the use of mitochondrial DNA in tracing human evolution and migration patterns. This includes studying the mitochondrial DNA of mammals in your dataset to draw parallels with human evolutionary studies.

### Data Sources

The mitochondrial DNA data for birds, mammals, and insects will be provided to you. This dataset has been curated to facilitate a comprehensive comparative analysis and is essential for the completion of your phylogenetic studies.
