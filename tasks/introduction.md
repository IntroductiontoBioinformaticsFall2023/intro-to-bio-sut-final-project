## Important Note on Project Deadline

Please be aware that the deadline for this project is set for the **16th of Bahman**. Due to the time constraints associated with grading and releasing the final grades, this deadline will not be subject to change. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to this timeline.

### Project Introduction

In this project, you'll delve into the fascinating realm of bird genetics and their evolutionary paths. It's an opportunity to use bioinformatics methods to tackle actual biological puzzles, with a particular emphasis on uncovering genetic secrets and the evolutionary links among various bird species. To get started, you can find all the project materials in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/IntroductiontoBioinformaticsFall2023/intro-to-bio-sut-final-project).


### Project Tasks

Refer to the README of the github repository.

### Methodology and Freedom of Exploration

Throughout these tasks, you are encouraged to employ a variety of bioinformatics tools and approaches. The aim is to foster creativity, problem-solving skills, and the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

## Grading and Bonus Structure

### Overview

The grading system for this project is designed to recognize and reward in-depth effort, creativity, and adherence to best practices. Each task includes embedded bonus opportunities, and we will also acknowledge any extra depth or analysis that goes beyond the specified task descriptions.

### Base Points

- Your project starts with a base of 4 points.

### Multiplicative Bonus Factors

- **Clean Coding**: We strongly encourage clean, modular code with reusable components. Well-written and well-documented code will multiply the task's grade by 1.1.
- **Git Best Practices**: Effective use of Git, including good commit practices and clear commit messages, will yield a multiplicative factor of 1.1 on the task's grade.

### Soft-Cap Bonus

- You can gain an extra 1.5 points by completing bonus activities within each task or meeting other bonus criteria. This can raise your total to 6 points.

### Extended Bonus Opportunity

- If you're aiming beyond 5.5 points, thereâ€™s a chance to earn one more point. This is quite challenging and doesn't include regular bonuses like clean coding. The criteria here are open: you get this point for putting in a lot of effort, adding educational value, and documenting your work well.

### Task-Specific Bonus

- While each task might have its own bonus activities, you're not limited to these. The course is designed for you to get practical experience, so feel free to expand your notebooks in creative ways. This could mean going deeper into a topic or covering more ground.
- We haven't set strict rules for bonus points for each task because there are many ways you could approach them. You can make your task broader or more detailed. We know this might seem a bit uncertain, but it's hard to have a fixed rule for every possible expansion you might think of.
- If you do extra work that you think deserves a bonus, please write about it in a dedicated document. Explain what you did, why it's valuable, and what you learned. Include anything else you think is important.
- You can expand almost all tasks in different ways. Whether you decide to cover more topics or dive deep into one area, make sure to document everything well. Write about why you chose to add certain sections, how you approached them, your results, and your thoughts on why things worked or didn't work.

### In-Person Delivery and Individual Assessment

As part of the completion requirements, you will be required to deliver your final project. The specifics of the delivery method, whether online or in-person, will be communicated to you at a later date.

## Deliverables

Your GitHub repository will serve as the primary delivery mechanism for your project. It should contain all the necessary files and documents related to your project tasks. In the event that your project includes large files, please upload these to an appropriate hosting service and provide a direct link to them in your repository.

For tasks that involve a notebook, the notebook itself will serve as both the code and the report. For other tasks, you will need to write a separate report. In addition, for all tasks, there may be a need to write an additional report. This could be the case if you have undertaken any extra bonus activities within a task, or if you have used additional tools or websites.

Any extra work, such as bonus activities, should be highlighted in your report. Similarly, if you have used additional tools or websites in any of your tasks, you should specify the tools you have used and the steps you took in your report.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the tasks but also to document your process, your learnings, and your achievements. Good luck!
